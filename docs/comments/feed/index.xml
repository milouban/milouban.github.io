If this were real copy, it would have ended long ago, because‚ as we all know‚ no one reads body copy, and even fewer read body copy this long. But then, this is dummy copy. It is not meant to be read. Period.]]></description>

That’s why they call it, the dummy copy.]]></description>

(After all, that’s a reader’s job: to read, isn’t it?)
